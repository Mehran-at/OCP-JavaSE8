/*
    The key to understand this code is to notice that our thread pool size is only 2, but our CyclicBarrier
    limit is 3. Even though 12 tasks are all successfully submitted to the thread executor service by way of the stream
    forEach() method, the first two tasks will use up both available threads and wait indefinitely. Since a third await()
    is never executed, the barrier is never broken and program hangs, making H correct answer. No output no exceptions
